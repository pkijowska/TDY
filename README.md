:octocat: Created a google chrome plugin clone of [Momentum](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/momentum/laookkfknpbbblfpciffpaejjkokdgca?hl=en).

## Features

```sh
Display random quote using quotes API which I created in MongoDB/Mongoose
Display a random backgroundImage using unsplash API
Google form to browse google
Display current time
Add a todo list
See the current weather in your location
Use it as your chrome plugin
```

The project will get the user's location and return current temperature using Openweather API and HTML Geolocation API

## Technology used
1. React
2. Sass
3. API (Openweather, Geolocation, Unsplash)
4. MongoDB, Mongoose and ROBO 3T - Created my own API with list of quotes which I like (QuoteAPI as the one from the internet was not good)
